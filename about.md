Hi, I'm Rob.

I'm a biological oceanographer and data scientist. For the last little while my work has been focused on the use and development of tailored ocean colour products in the Southern Ocean. I have developed new and improved satellite chlorophyll algorithms for the Southern Ocean and I am currently working on improving remote sensing techniques for quantifying calcite (from Coccolithophores) and phytoplankton functional types in the Southern Ocean.

At the centre of all my work is the microscopic life that lives in the sea â€“ the phytoplankton. Phytoplankton are the small microscopic plants responsible for almost half the photosynthesis and primary production on our planet. Through photosynthesis these tiny organisms produce oxygen and soak up carbon in every body of water on earth. Consider that the oxygen in every second breath we take comes from phytoplankton and their vital importance to our everyday lives and the health of the planet becomes apparent.

This website is a place for you to find out about me, a place for me to post tools and links that I find useful, and a glorified business card should you wish to work with me.
