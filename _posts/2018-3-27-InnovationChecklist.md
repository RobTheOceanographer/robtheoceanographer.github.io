title: Checklist for Technological Innovation in Data Science
excerpt:
         <p>How do we decide when or if to change or adopt an innovation in our work?</p>
---

Lately I've been thinking about how one decides to adopt new technology or change the way one works. There's a lot of push for Data Scientists to keep up with the latest and greatest innovation in IT or analysis (e.g. change to `git` rather than staying with `svn`) but there's rarely any objective analysis or thought put into whether or not a Data Scientist *should* invest the time and energy in doing this. Therefore I decided to put together a list of principles that I hold and use a a yard stick when presented with such situations. These are presented below.

### 1 â€“ The new tool of method should be cheaper than the one it replaces.

### 2 - It should be at least as fast as the tool or method it replaces.

### 3 - It should do work or produce work that is clearly and demonstrably 'better' than the one it replaces.

### 4 - It should be repairable and maintainable by people inside the organisation, provided that they are provided with the necessary tools.

### 5 - It should not replace or disrupt anything good that already exists, and this includes people and community relationships.
