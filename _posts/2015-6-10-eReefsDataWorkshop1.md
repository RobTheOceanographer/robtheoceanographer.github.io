Today I'm teaching at the first [Bureau of Meteorology eReefs](http://www.bom.gov.au/marinewaterquality/) satellite data training workshop in [Townsville QLD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Townsville). I've spent the last week or so preparing and putting together a sensible (*hopefully*) series of short lessons.

During my prep I borrowed heavily from the style of the [Software-Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) training material and I even set up a [workshop webpage](https://ereefs.github.io/) by bastardising a [blog template](http://www.robtheoceanographer.com/MyFirstPost/) and hosted it on [GitHub](https://pages.github.com/).

Unfortunately, I had no idea what level my audience was at before I created the material and I only had 4 hours to cram in what felt like two days worth of material. My solution - pitch to the lowest common level and provide lots of extra reading material for the students to take away to use as reference later.

Thank you [software carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) instructor training (and [Bill Mills](https://twitter.com/billdoesphysics)/[Damien Irving](https://twitter.com/drclimate)) for building my confidence to teach scientific computing/data science out in the open.
