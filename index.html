Hi, I'm Rob. I'm a Data Scientist and Oceanographer.
<br>
<br>
I've spent the last decade working on projects where Marine Science and Data Science collide. For the last little while my work has been focused on the development, optimisation, and use of bespoke satellite remote sensing methods for the Oceans.
<br>
<br>
There are two core elements at the centre of my work. Firstly, a drive to do data intensive science and to make research results practical through progressing the state of the art of scientific software engineering & data science, and through the operationalisation of emerging research into useful and reusable products or services. Secondly, the microscopic life that lives in the sea - the phytoplankton. Phytoplankton are the small microscopic plants responsible for almost half the photosynthesis and primary production on our planet. Through photosynthesis these tiny organisms produce oxygen and soak up carbon in every body of water on earth. Consider that the oxygen in every second breath we take comes from phytoplankton and their vital importance to our everyday lives and the health of the planet becomes apparent.
