Hi, I'm Rob. I'm a Biological Oceanographer and Data Scientist.<br>
<br>
I've spent the last decade working on projects where Marine Science and Data Science collide. For the last little while my work has been focused on the use
and development of tailored satellite remote sensing products in the
Southern Ocean.<br>
<br>
There are two core elements at the centre of all my work. Firstly, the
microscopic life that lives in the sea - the phytoplankton. Phytoplankton
are the small microscopic plants responsible for almost half the
photosynthesis and primary production on our planet. Through photosynthesis
these tiny organisms produce oxygen and soak up carbon in every body of
water on earth. Consider that the oxygen in every second breath we take
comes from phytoplankton and their vital importance to our everyday lives
and the health of the planet becomes apparent. Secondly, the drive to make
environmental science and data practical through taking science and
technologies that are just emerging and making them useful.<br>
