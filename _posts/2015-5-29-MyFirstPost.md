title: Migrating to GitHub and Jekyll
---
I used to host this site on Weebly as it's pretty much set and forget website hosting, but since i've been using git and markdown more and more in my daily work I've decided to move to GitHub and Jekyll.

I initially thought that this was going to be a hassle to do but then i found this [article](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) by [Barry Clark](https://twitter.com/BazNYC) and i was sold.

The advantages of the GitHub and Jekyll combo is that it looks good and it's free! plus, I really like writing Markdown!
