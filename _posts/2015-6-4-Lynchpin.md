Two years in the making and the *ex Oceano* symphony is out!

*ex Oceano* is a creative venture in sound – a collaborative expression between disciplines and understandings.

The wonderful [Nick Roden](https://twitter.com/nickproden) and I expressed our understanding of science to a composer - [Matthew Dewey](http://www.lynchpin.org.au/our-projects/ex-oceano/about-the-composer/) then the composer expressed that science back to us in sound – by making a symphony.

This made for a way to generate a different experience of ocean science and promote understanding of the role of the ocean in supporting life.
